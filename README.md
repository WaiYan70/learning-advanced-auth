this project is to learn advanced authentication features like Email Verification, Password Recovery, Welcome Emails and so on, which I will mention in details below.

I like to try the new files/folders structures of MERN stack and learn new tools.

Tools:
1. nodemailer: seding email messages library/ modules
2. Brevo: SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) server

Features:
1. Email Verification
2. Forget/Reset/Password Recovery
3. Welcome Emails
